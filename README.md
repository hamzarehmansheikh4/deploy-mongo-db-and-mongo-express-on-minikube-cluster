# Deploy-MongoDb-and-MongoExpress-On-Minikube-Cluster

I successfully deployed MongoDB and Mongo Express on a Minikube cluster, creating a local development environment for database management. Using Kubernetes, I set up MongoDB as a StatefulSet and Mongo Express as a Deployment, ensuring scalable and reliable database access. This setup allows developers to interact with MongoDB through Mongo Express's web-based interface, streamlining database management tasks. Minikube provides a lightweight, local Kubernetes cluster, making it easy to test and deploy applications before moving to a production environment. The result is a robust and scalable deployment that enhances local development workflows for MongoDB applications.
